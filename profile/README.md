## 🙋‍♀️ What We're All About

We're building the **complete hospitality technology ecosystem** for India! Think of us as the tech backbone that powers both hotels and travelers:

🏨 **For Hotels**: A powerful Property Management System (PMS) that handles everything from reservations to billing, housekeeping to analytics. It's like having a super-smart assistant that never sleeps!

✈️ **For Travelers**: A modern Online Travel Agency (OTA) platform that makes finding and booking the perfect stay as easy as ordering your favorite food online.

### Our Mission?
Make world-class hotel technology accessible and affordable for every property in India - from boutique guesthouses to large hotel chains. No more expensive, complicated systems. Just simple, powerful tools that work.
